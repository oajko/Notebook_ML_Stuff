CenterNet stuff

Train time on local device was long, so model is heavy overfitting and bad predictor. Didn't use many epoch, skipped augmentation, and used < 1000 training images on model with several million parameters, so bad result was expected. But main.ipynb shows, at least from numbers POV, that the model runs and works as intented.
